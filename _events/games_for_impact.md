In the winter of 2020 I had a chance to participate in the online festival of games with a social impact which attracted speakers from different parts of the gaming sector, from indie developer to bigger Polish companies such as 11 bit studio, academics, journalists, enthusiasts to workers of European Commission. 

Games for Impact festival focused on topics such as

* silver gaming - fighting the stigma that older people do not play video games
* games for accessibility - how to create games for visually & hearing impaired and those with various mobility limitations 
* how to fight against fake news and disinformation by using games
* how to create more inclusive games, building better minority characters
* games for political change - case study of Belerus revolution
* games for kids, usage of games in schools

and many more.

During 4 days we could listen to 44 speakers from across the world, ask them questions during Q&A sessions and play in 41 selected games which were remarkable examples of the topics mentioned during the festival.
