I'm a software developer from Poland with a passion for computer science and its application in different fields of science. In my work I try to combine technical and artistic approaches to have the best of both worlds. 

I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Bialystok University of Technology. While attending BUT, I began my carrer as a Junior R&D Engineer for Moose Inc, creating a cloud computing architecture which uses Computer Vision in Medical Imaging. 

Throughout my academic years I was a member of the Students’ Scientific Circle of Biometry, Analysis and Processing of Images and Signals and „Math4you” Students’ Scientific Circle which, later on, I became a president. I have participated in Nationwide Session of Students of Mathematics at Jagiellonian University and many others, local academic conferences and meetings of programming communities, which topics ranged from linear programming and AI to UX\UI. I'm mostly active in PyStok, group of Python enthusiasts who live in Bialystok and surroundings.

My second interest is in the game design. In one-year teamwork project required in curriculum I was an artistic director and programmer of game called UnforgivenParadise. My Bachelor's thesis was to design and implement location-based, educational, puzzle game on mobile devices called Promenado which aims to tell a story about forgotten places and people who lived in Bialystok. It was my first, independent game which prototype is available to play at my [itch.io site][promenado] (password: name of the game in lowercase).
