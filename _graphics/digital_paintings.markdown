「I Lost Something in the Hills」 04.2020
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Where first love and soul takes rise<br/>
There were times in my life<br/>
When I felt mad and deprived<br/>
And only the slopes gave me hope<br/>
When I pass through the leg-high grass I shall die<br/>
Under the jasmin I shall die<br/>
And the elder tree<br/>
I need not try to prepare for a new coming day<br/>
Where is it that fills the deepness I feel</i>
