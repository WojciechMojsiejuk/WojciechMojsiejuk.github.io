    <i>
    Graphic created after many records of police violence against women and LGBT+ activists in Poland after enforcing abortion ban.
    It combines "Zdejmij mundur, przeproś matkę" (eng. Take off your police uniform, apologise to your mother), a slogan used at demonstrations, with an issue many women are affected by, that is receiving unsolicited genital images from men (Police baton is a word play which could refer to a part of male genitalia)</i>
